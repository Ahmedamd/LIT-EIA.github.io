Today, we will learn how to assess the budget portion of an application for funding&nbsp;</p><p>However, just before we jump right into that, I’d like to welcome back our resident expert, Marius. As you know, Marius is a Grants and Contributions Practitioner with our department. Marius will introduce us to one of the contributions programs called the Better Futures program. Marius, welcome back to the program!</p><p><strong>Marius</strong>: Thank you, Brigitte. It’s always a pleasure to come back to <em>People Helping People</em>.</p><p><strong>Brigitte</strong>: So Marius, in the last two episodes of our program, you have been leading our audience through an assessment of an application for funding from an organization called An Apple A Day Inc. As we’ve seen, An Apple A Day Inc. has applied to a program called Better Futures. Can you tell us a little bit about the program?</p><p><strong>Marius</strong>: Absolutely, Brigitte. If we look at our departmental operational priorities, the BF program, as we call it, falls under the social development branch. The overreaching goal of this branch is to improve access to opportunities and well-being for individuals, families and communities. The Better Futures program allows us to do that by funding projects or other activities that contribute to supporting Canadians in making choices that help them live productive and rewarding lives, and in improving their overall quality of life.</p><p><strong>Brigitte</strong>: How did the Better Futures program come about?</p><p><strong>Marius</strong>: Well, in 2010, the department identified that there were significant gaps in social inclusiveness and health programming within certain communities across Canada. The BF program was created to provide funding and support to a broad range of activities aimed at addressing the specific circumstances surrounding communities that struggle with awareness, development and maintenance of healthy lifestyles and community involvement.</p><p><strong>Brigitte</strong>: What are the short-term and long-term goals of the program?</p><p><strong>Marius</strong>: In the short-term, the program’s aim is to help people and organizations within the community become involved in the community and focus on living healthy lifestyles and, secondly, to research results on the importance of a healthy lifestyle and community involvement. In the longer-term, the BF program’s goal is to help Canadians maintain healthy lifestyles and increase their participation in the community.</p><p><strong>Brigitte</strong>:<br />The program certainly sounds like it lives up to its name, Marius!</p><p><strong>Marius</strong>:<br />You’re right, Brigitte. As we’ve seen, An Apple A Day Inc. Inc. has applied for funding from the Better Futures program and in the last episode, we assessed both the Apple A Day organization and their Be Healthy for Life project. On today’s show, we’ll assess the proposed project’s budget.</p>",

I’m your host, Brigitte, and on today’s show we’ll be continuing with the third phase of the Grants and Contributions Project Life Cycle, the assessment of an application for funding. Today, we will learn how to assess the budget portion of an application for funding&nbsp;</p><p>However, just before we jump right into that, I’d like to welcome back our resident expert, Marius. As you know, Marius is a Grants and Contributions Practitioner with our department. Marius will introduce us to one of the contributions programs called the Better Futures program. Marius, welcome back to the program!</p><p><strong>Marius</strong>: Thank you, Brigitte. It’s always a pleasure to come back to <em>People Helping People</em>.</p><p><strong>Brigitte</strong>: So Marius, in the last two episodes of our program, you have been leading our audience through an assessment of an application for funding from an organization called An Apple A Day Inc. As we’ve seen, An Apple A Day Inc. has applied to a program called Better Futures. Can you tell us a little bit about the program?</p><p><strong>Marius</strong>: Absolutely, Brigitte. If we look at our departmental operational priorities, the BF program, as we call it, falls under the social development branch. The overreaching goal of this branch is to improve access to opportunities and well-being for individuals, families and communities. The Better Futures program allows us to do that by funding projects or other activities that contribute to supporting Canadians in making choices that help them live productive and rewarding lives, and in improving their overall quality of life.</p><p><strong>Brigitte</strong>: How did the Better Futures program come about?</p><p><strong>Marius</strong>: Well, in 2010, the department identified that there were significant gaps in social inclusiveness and health programming within certain communities across Canada. The BF program was created to provide funding and support to a broad range of activities aimed at addressing the specific circumstances surrounding communities that struggle with awareness, development and maintenance of healthy lifestyles and community involvement.</p><p><strong>Brigitte</strong>: What are the short-term and long-term goals of the program?</p><p><strong>Marius</strong>: In the short-term, the program’s aim is to help people and organizations within the community become involved in the community and focus on living healthy lifestyles and, secondly, to research results on the importance of a healthy lifestyle and community involvement. In the longer-term, the BF program’s goal is to help Canadians maintain healthy lifestyles and increase their participation in the community.</p><p><strong>Brigitte</strong>:<br />The program certainly sounds like it lives up to its name, Marius!</p><p><strong>Marius</strong>:<br />You’re right, Brigitte. As we’ve seen, An Apple A Day Inc. Inc. has applied for funding from the Better Futures program and in the last episode, we assessed both the Apple A Day organization and their Be Healthy for Life project. On today’s show, we’ll assess the proposed project’s budget.</p>",
